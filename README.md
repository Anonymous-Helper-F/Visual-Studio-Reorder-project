# Visual-Studio-Reorder-project
Better organize your Visual Basic, C++, C# and Python projects in Visual Studio

Hello all dear readers,
this first project of mine published on GitHub aims to more easily reorder your Visual Basic, C++, C# and Python projects in Visual Studio.
There are three categories (Development Phase, Stand-by and Abandoned). You can simply select a project and place it into one of the category.
Also there are some bars that allow you to see at glance how many projects are in the categories.

I hope you enjoy my project!

This project was built with VB.net.
